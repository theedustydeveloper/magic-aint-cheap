            <h2>Welcome to The Gauntlet</h2>
            <p>
                You've been selected to compete in <strong>The Gauntlet</strong>, the galaxy's most popular death sport
                and the ultimate test of skill, strategy, and survival. Broadcast across countless systems, this
                dystopian game show throws contestants into deadly challenges where magic isn't just power—it's
                currency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every spell you cast, every weapon you swing, every piece of armor you wear must be purchased with
                hard-earned Gold. The cameras are rolling, the audience is watching, and only the strongest, smartest,
                and wealthiest will survive.
            </p>

            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <h3>Player Count & Cooperation</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Magic Ain't Cheap</strong> is designed for 1-4 players working together as a team. This is a
                fully cooperative game—you win together or fail together. The game automatically scales difficulty
                based on your party size.
            </p>

            <h3>Difficulty Modes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Easy Mode:</strong> Draw 6 cards during Reward Drafts. Trade freely with teammates.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium Mode:</strong> Draw 5 cards during Reward Drafts. Trading costs 5 Gold per card.</li>
                <li><strong>Hard Mode:</strong> Draw only 4 cards during Reward Drafts. Trading forbidden.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Game Length</h3>
            <p>
                A complete campaign takes approximately 2-3 hours to complete all three Floors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Floor 1: 30-45 minutes</li>
                <li>Floor 2: 45-60 minutes</li>
                <li>Floor 3: 60-90 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Gauntlet Structure</h3>
            <p>
                The Gauntlet consists of three brutal Floors, each with six deadly Challenges and one massive Boss
                fight. You'll start with almost nothing—just one die and a handful of basic equipment. As you progress,
                you'll level up, gain more dice, and unlock increasingly powerful gear.
            </p>

            <h2>Core Mechanics</h2>
            <h3>Gold Economy</h3>
            <p>
                Everything costs Gold. Every spell, weapon, armor piece, and enhancement must be purchased. Manage
                your resources carefully—running out of Gold means running out of options.
            </p>

            <h3>Dice Pool System</h3>
            <p>
                Your dice pool represents your energy and actions. Start with one die and earn more by defeating
                Bosses. Use dice to attack, cast spells, and activate abilities. Exhausted dice return after
                completing challenges.
            </p>

            <h3>The Green Room</h3>
            <p>
                Between challenges, rest in the Green Room—a safe zone where you can heal through Resting Rolls,
                shop for better gear, and prepare for what's ahead. Time is money, and every decision counts.
            </p>

            <h2>Death & Revival</h2>
            <p>
                Death is temporary in The Gauntlet. Thanks to corporate sponsorship and cutting-edge revival technology,
                contestants respawn in the Green Room after being knocked out. However, failure comes with consequences:
                you'll lose precious Gold, take heavy damage, and fall behind your competitors.
            </p>

            <h2>Win Condition</h2>
            <p>
                Can you and your team survive all three Floors and defeat the Final Boss? Or will you run out of Gold,
                HP, or luck before the final credits roll?
            </p>
