<h1>MAGIC AIN'T CHEAP - OFFICIAL RULEBOOK</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">WELCOME TO THE GAUNTLET</h2>

<p>Welcome, contestant! You've been selected to compete in <em>The Gauntlet</em>, the galaxy's most popular death sport and the ultimate test of skill, strategy, and survival. Broadcast across countless systems, this dystopian game show throws contestants into deadly challenges where magic isn't just power—it's currency. Every spell you cast, every weapon you swing, every piece of armor you wear must be purchased with hard-earned Gold. The cameras are rolling, the audience is watching, and only the strongest, smartest, and wealthiest will survive.</p>

<p>But don't worry—death is temporary in The Gauntlet. Thanks to corporate sponsorship and cutting-edge revival technology, contestants respawn in the Green Room after being knocked out. However, that doesn't mean there aren't consequences. Fail a Challenge and you'll lose precious Gold, take heavy damage, and fall behind your competitors.</p>

<p>Between the chaos of the Challenge Arena, you'll find sanctuary in the Green Room—a safe zone where you can rest, heal your wounds through risky Resting Rolls, shop for better gear, and prepare for what's ahead. But time is money, and every decision counts. Will you spend your Gold on powerful weapons, invest in permanent stat Enhancements, or save up for that critical sixth die?</p>

<p>The Gauntlet consists of three brutal Floors, each with six deadly Challenges and one massive Boss fight. You'll start with almost nothing—just one die and a handful of basic equipment. As you progress, you'll level up, gain more dice, and unlock increasingly powerful gear. But the Challenges get harder, the Bosses get meaner, and the economic pressure never lets up.</p>

<p>Can you and your team survive all three Floors and defeat the Final Boss? Or will you run out of Gold, HP, or luck before the final credits roll?</p>

<strong>Let's find out. The show is about to begin.</strong>

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="how-to-play">HOW TO PLAY</h2>

<h2>Player Count and Cooperation</h2>

<p>Magic Ain't Cheap is designed for 1-4 players working together as a team. This is a fully cooperative game—you win together or fail together. The game automatically scales difficulty based on your party size, spawning more monsters and increasing HP pools when you have 3-4 players compared to 1-2 players.</p>

<h2>Difficulty Modes</h2>

<p>Before you begin, your party must vote on a difficulty mode. This choice is locked for the entire game and cannot be changed. The difficulty mode affects how many cards you draw during Reward Drafts and whether you can trade cards with teammates.</p>

<strong>Easy Mode:</strong> Draw 6 cards during Reward Drafts. Keep all cards and trade freely with teammates at no cost. This mode is perfect for learning the game or for players who want to focus on strategy over scarcity.

<strong>Medium Mode:</strong> Draw 5 cards during Reward Drafts. Trading is allowed but costs 5 Gold per card traded to another player. This mode adds economic tension while still allowing cooperation.

<strong>Hard Mode:</strong> Draw only 4 cards during Reward Drafts. Trading is completely forbidden—what you draft is what you get. This mode is for veterans who want maximum challenge and scarcity.

<h2>Game Length</h2>

<p>A complete campaign of Magic Ain't Cheap takes approximately 2-3 hours to complete all three Floors. Individual Floor times vary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Floor 1: 30-45 minutes</li>
<li>Floor 2: 45-60 minutes</li>
<li>Floor 3: 60-90 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Need</h2>

<p>To play Magic Ain't Cheap, you'll need the following components:</p>

<strong>Cards:</strong>
<ul>
<li>45 Challenge cards (15 per Floor Level, 3 Levels per Floor)</li>
<li>15 Boss cards (5 per Floor)</li>
<li>Monster cards</li>
<li>Environment cards</li>
<li>Treasure cards</li>
<li>Reward Deck (600 cards total):</li>
<li>Floor 1: 300 cards (90 Enhancements, 54 Weapons, 48 Armor, 45 Spells, 30 Items, 18 Favors, 15 Kits)</li>
<li>Floor 2: 200 cards (60 Enhancements, 36 Weapons, 32 Armor, 30 Spells, 20 Items, 12 Favors, 10 Kits)</li>
<li>Floor 3: 100 cards (30 Enhancements, 18 Weapons, 16 Armor, 15 Spells, 10 Items, 6 Favors, 5 Kits)</li>
<li>6 Basic Stat Cards (one for each stat: Might, Speed, Intelligence, Willpower, Charm, Luck)</li>
<li>Token cards (Skeleton, Clone, Guardian)</li>
<li>Effect cards (Poison, status conditions)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Other Components:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20 (multiple of each)</li>
<li>Gold tokens</li>
<li>HP trackers</li>
<li>Player boards with designated areas for dice pools, enhancements, equipment, inventory, HP, and Gold</li>
<li>Game board showing Green Room, Challenge Arena, Floor Tracker, and deck placement zones</li>
<li>Player tokens (cards or miniatures to represent characters)</li>
</ul>

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="setup">SETTING UP THE GAME</h2>

<h2>Character Creation</h2>

<p>Each player creates their own character before the game begins. Character creation involves choosing your difficulty mode, determining your starting stats, and drafting your first equipment.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Choose Difficulty Mode</h3>

<p>Your party must vote on Easy, Medium, or Hard mode. Once chosen, this difficulty setting applies to the entire campaign and cannot be changed.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Determine Starting Stats</h3>

<p>Your starting stats depend on the difficulty mode you selected. There are six Basic Stat Cards available, one for each of the six stats in the game: Might, Speed, Intelligence, Willpower, Charm, and Luck. Each Basic Stat Card provides +1 to its corresponding stat.</p>

<strong>Easy Mode:</strong> Each player chooses 1 Basic Stat Card. For example, if you pick the Might Card, you start with Might 1 and all other stats at 0. This mode lets you plan your build from the beginning.

<strong>Medium Mode:</strong> Shuffle all 6 Basic Stat Cards together. Each player draws 1 random card and receives that stat bonus. This mode forces you to adapt your strategy around what you're given.

<strong>Hard Mode:</strong> No Basic Stat Cards are used. All players start with every stat at 0. You must build your stats entirely through purchased Enhancement cards. This is the ultimate challenge.

<h3>Step 3: Set Starting Resources</h3>

<p>Every player starts with 30 HP (this value may be adjusted during playtesting) and 0 Gold.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Draft Starting Equipment</h3>

<p>There is no separate "Starter Deck" in Magic Ain't Cheap. Instead, all players draft their starting equipment directly from the Floor 1 Reward Deck.</p>

<p>Each player draws 6 cards from the shuffled Floor 1 Reward Deck. After reviewing the cards privately, choose 4 cards to keep and discard the other 2 to the communal discard pile. The 4 cards you keep are yours for free—no Gold cost. You can equip them immediately.</p>

<p>This system creates variance and replayability. One player might draw powerful weapons and spells, while another might get basic armor and utility items. Some players start strong, others have to work harder early on. This is by design—embrace the chaos!</p>

<p>You cannot trade cards during character creation. What you draft is what you get (at least until you start earning Gold).</p>

<h3>Step 5: Choose Your First Die</h3>

<p>Each player selects 1 die to start with. You can choose any die type: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, or D20. This is your starting dice pool. As you level up throughout the game, you'll gain more dice, up to a maximum of 6 dice.</p>

<p>Choose wisely! A D4 provides consistent, low-variance results, while a D20 offers extreme swings of fortune.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Game Board</h2>

<h3>Floor Tracker Setup</h3>

<p>Place the game board in the center of the play area. The Floor Tracker shows 7 slots for Floor 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 slots for Level 1 Challenges</li>
<li>3 slots for Level 2 Challenges</li>
<li>1 slot for the Boss</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenge Deck Preparation</h3>

<strong>Level 1 Challenges:</strong> Shuffle the 15 Level 1 Challenge cards. Draw 3 cards randomly and place them face-down in the Level 1 slots from left to right. The remaining 12 cards are set aside (not used this playthrough).

<strong>Level 2 Challenges:</strong> Shuffle the 15 Level 2 Challenge cards. Draw 3 cards randomly and place them face-down in the Level 2 slots from left to right. The remaining 12 cards are set aside.

<h3>Boss Card Selection</h3>

<p>Shuffle the 5 Floor 1 Boss cards. Draw 1 randomly and place it face-up in the Boss slot. On Floor 1, the Boss is visible from the start so you can plan for it. On Floors 2 and 3, the Boss card is placed face-down.</p>

<p>The 4 unused Boss cards are set aside.</p>

<h3>Monster Deck Setup</h3>

<p>Shuffle the Level 1 Monster Deck (approximately 20 cards) and place it near the Challenge Arena. Later, when you progress to Level 2, you'll shuffle the Level 2 Monster Deck separately.</p>

<h3>Environment and Treasure Decks</h3>

<p>Shuffle the 6 Floor 1 Environment cards and place the deck near the Challenge Arena. Shuffle the Treasure Deck and place it nearby as well.</p>

<h3>Reward Deck Setup</h3>

<p>Shuffle all 300 Floor 1 Reward cards into one massive deck. This is your shopping deck for the entire Floor. Place it within easy reach of all players. Keep the Gold tokens nearby.</p>

<h3>Card Groups (Non-Shuffled)</h3>

<p>Set out the following card groups where all players can access them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Token cards (Skeleton, Clone, Guardian)</li>
<li>Effect cards (Poison markers, status conditions)</li>
<li>Basic Stat Cards (if not all used during character creation)</li>
</ul>

<p>These cards are brought into the game as needed—they're not drawn randomly.</p>

<h3>First Challenge Reveal</h3>

<p>Flip the first Challenge card face-up. The party now knows what the first Challenge will be. This is intentional—you always get a preview of what's coming so you can shop accordingly.</p>

<p>Players now enter the Green Room to prepare for their first Challenge.</p>

<h2>Player Board Layout</h2>

<p>Each player organizes their player board with the following areas:</p>

<h3>Dice Pools</h3>

<p>Your dice pool is divided into two sub-areas:</p>

<strong>Unactivated Dice Pool:</strong> This is where your available dice are kept at the start of each turn or round. These dice are ready to be used for attacks, skill tests, abilities, or other actions.

<strong>Exhausted Dice Pool:</strong> When you use a die for an action, it moves here. Dice in the Exhausted Pool cannot be used again until they reset. At the end of your turn (or at the end of the round, depending on the specific mechanic), all exhausted dice move back to the Unactivated Pool.

<strong>Special Note:</strong> When you activate a Kit card in the Green Room, you move one die from your Unactivated Pool to your Exhausted Pool <em>without rolling it</em>. That die remains exhausted for the entire next Challenge.

<h3>Enhancements Area</h3>

<p>This area is reserved for Enhancement cards—permanent stat modifications that attach to your character forever. Enhancements never go into your inventory or hand. Once purchased, they're placed here and remain visible and active for the rest of the game.</p>

<p>Even if an Enhancement card has an exhaustible ability, the stat bonuses it provides are <em>always</em> active, regardless of whether the ability is currently exhausted.</p>

<h3>Equipped Items and Spells Area</h3>

<p>This is where you place your currently equipped gear. Equipment slots are organized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Head:</strong> 1 slot (helmets, hats, hoods)</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> 1 slot (chest armor, robes, jackets)</li>
<li><strong>Arms:</strong> 1 slot (arm guards, bracers, sleeves)</li>
<li><strong>Legs:</strong> 1 slot (leg armor, pants, greaves)</li>
<li><strong>Hands:</strong> 2 slots (weapons, shields, gloves)</li>
<li><strong>Accessory:</strong> 1 slot (rings, amulets, trinkets)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Spells</strong> have no slot limit—you can equip as many spells as you want simultaneously.

<strong>Kits</strong> are also equipped here when activated. They do not count against your equipment slots.

<p>Only one item can be equipped per slot. If you own multiple items for the same slot (for example, two different helmets), you must choose which one to equip. The unequipped item stays in your inventory.</p>

<h3>Inventory (Your Hand)</h3>

<p>Your inventory represents cards you own but aren't currently using. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unequipped weapons, armor, and items</li>
<li>Favor cards (which cannot be equipped and must stay in your hand until used)</li>
<li>Drafted cards that you haven't purchased yet</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access and reorganize your inventory freely while in the Green Room. However, you cannot swap equipment during a Challenge.</p>

<h3>HP Tracker</h3>

<p>Track your current HP and maximum HP here. When you take damage, reduce your current HP. When you heal (through Resting Rolls), increase your current HP, but never exceed your maximum.</p>

<h3>Gold Counter</h3>

<p>Track how much Gold you currently have. You'll earn Gold by completing Challenges, dealing damage, and taking damage. You'll spend Gold to purchase cards from your drafted hand or from the discard pile.</p>

<h2>Game Board Zones</h2>

<p>The shared game board contains several important zones:</p>

<h3>Player Tokens</h3>

<p>Place cards or miniatures representing each player character on the board. These tokens are used during transitions between the Green Room and the Challenge Arena, providing a visual representation of where your party currently is.</p>

<h3>Green Room Zone</h3>

<p>This zone represents the safe area between Challenges. When your tokens are here, you cannot be attacked, and you have time to rest, shop, and prepare. There's no time pressure in the Green Room—the party decides when to proceed.</p>

<h3>Challenge Arena Zone</h3>

<p>This is where Challenges take place. Monsters, Environment cards, and objective markers are placed here during a Challenge. When your tokens are in the Arena, combat and skill tests occur.</p>

<strong>Important:</strong> Magic Ain't Cheap does <em>not</em> use positioning or placement mechanics. There are no movement rules, no distance measurements, and no "heal the closest player" effects. All combat and interactions are abstract. Players and monsters simply "exist" in the Arena together.

<h3>Floor Tracker</h3>

<p>The Floor Tracker visually represents your progress through the current Floor. Challenge cards are placed face-down in their slots and flipped face-up when revealed. Level markings (Level 1, Level 2, Boss) help you track where you are in the game.</p>

<h3>Decks (Shuffled)</h3>

<p>The following decks are shuffled and placed on the board. You draw from these during gameplay:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reward Deck (300 cards on Floor 1)</li>
<li>Monster Deck (for spawning enemies)</li>
<li>Challenge Decks (Level 1 and Level 2)</li>
<li>Environment Deck (environmental hazards)</li>
<li>Treasure Deck (bonus loot)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Card Groups (Available, Not Shuffled)</h3>

<p>The following card groups are available but not shuffled or drawn from randomly. You simply take them when needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Token cards (Skeleton, Clone, Guardian) - summoned when abilities are used</li>
<li>Effect cards (Poison markers, status conditions) - placed when effects trigger</li>
<li>Basic Stat Cards (used during character creation only)</li>
</ul>

<p>---</p>

<h2>THE CORE GAME LOOP</h2>

<p>Magic Ain't Cheap follows a repeating cycle of phases. You'll move through the Green Room Phase, Challenge Phase, and Rewards Phase over and over until you complete all six Challenges and defeat the Boss.</p>

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="green-room">GREEN ROOM PHASE</h2>

<h2>What is the Green Room?</h2>

<p>The Green Room is your sanctuary. It's a safe zone where no monsters can reach you, no time limits pressure you, and no dangers threaten you. This is where you catch your breath, lick your wounds, spend your hard-earned Gold, and prepare for the next Challenge.</p>

<p>You have complete control over how long you stay in the Green Room. Take your time. Plan your strategy. Trade Gold with teammates. Equip better gear. When everyone is ready, you'll proceed to the next Challenge.</p>

<h2>Green Room Phase Order</h2>

<p>Follow these steps in order each time you enter the Green Room:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Resting Roll (Optional, Per Player)</h3>

<p>After completing a Challenge, each player individually decides whether to attempt a Resting Roll. This is the <em>only</em> way to heal in the game—there are no healing potions, no healing spells, and no other recovery mechanics. The Resting Roll is free, but it's risky.</p>

<strong>How It Works:</strong>

<p>If you choose to rest, select one die from your Unactivated Dice Pool. Roll it. You heal HP equal to the result. For example, if you roll a D8 and get a 6, you heal 6 HP. If you roll a D20 and get a 15, you heal 15 HP. Your HP cannot exceed your maximum (30 HP by default).</p>

<p>Critically, rolling a die for a Resting Roll does <em>not</em> exhaust it. You can still use that die during the upcoming Challenge. The Resting Roll simply determines how much you heal—it doesn't cost you anything except a moment of luck.</p>

<strong>Strategic Considerations:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Which die should you roll?</strong> A D4 guarantees at least 1 HP of healing but caps at 4. A D20 could heal you for 20 HP, but you might roll a 1 and only heal 1 HP.</li>
<li><strong>Do you even need healing?</strong> If you're at full HP, skip the Resting Roll entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Should you gamble?</strong> If you're at 5 HP and need healing desperately, rolling a D20 might save you—or it might only heal you for 1 HP and leave you vulnerable.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an individual decision. Player A might rest and roll a D6. Player B might skip resting because they're at full HP. Player C might gamble on a D20. Player D might rest with a safe D4.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Reward Draft (If Just Completed a Challenge)</h3>

<p>If you just completed a Challenge, you'll draft new cards from the Reward Deck. The number of cards you draft depends on your difficulty mode:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy Mode:</strong> Draw 6 cards.</li>
<li><strong>Medium Mode:</strong> Draw 5 cards.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Mode:</strong> Draw 4 cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each player draws their cards from the Reward Deck and reviews them privately. After reviewing, you may trade cards with teammates according to your difficulty mode's rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy Mode:</strong> Trading is free. Swap cards with anyone.</li>
<li><strong>Medium Mode:</strong> Trading costs 5 Gold per card traded.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Mode:</strong> Trading is completely forbidden.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep all drafted cards in your inventory (hand). You can only <em>purchase</em> them during the Rewards Phase (after the next Challenge ends), not now in the Green Room. This creates strategic tension—you're drafting cards for a Challenge you haven't seen yet!</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> The first time you enter the Green Room (at the start of the game), you do not draft cards because you haven't completed a Challenge yet. You only have the 4 cards you kept during character creation.

<h3>Step 3: Purchase Cards (From Drafted Hand Only)</h3>

<p>You can only purchase cards during the Rewards Phase, <em>not</em> during the Green Room Phase. This step is listed here for clarity, but you cannot buy new Reward cards right now. You must wait until after the next Challenge ends.</p>

<p>However, you <em>can</em> spend Gold to purchase cards from the communal discard pile if needed.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Equip and Re-equip Cards</h3>

<p>Now that you've reviewed your drafted cards and know what the next Challenge will be (it was revealed at the end of the last Rewards Phase), you can equip your gear.</p>

<p>You can freely swap equipment while in the Green Room. Unequip items that aren't useful for the upcoming Challenge and equip better options. Organize your equipment slots (Head, Body, Arms, Legs, Hands, Accessory) and decide which spells to have active.</p>

<p>Remember: Kits are equipped here and do not count against your equipment slots.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Kits (If Applicable)</h3>

<p>If you own a Kit card, you can activate it here in the Green Room. Kits are special, bulky items that take significant time or space to use—think workout machines, medical stations, ritual circles, or crafting benches. They provide powerful buffs that last until the end of the next Challenge, but they come with a cost.</p>

<strong>How to Activate a Kit:</strong>

<p>1. Choose one die from your Unactivated Dice Pool.</p>
<p>2. Move that die to your Exhausted Dice Pool <em>without rolling it</em>.</p>
<p>3. Apply the Kit's buff or bonus effect (follow the card's instructions).</p>
<p>4. The effect lasts until the end of the next Challenge.</p>

<p>The die you used for the Kit remains exhausted for the entire next Challenge. This means you'll have one fewer die available during combat. For example, if you have 3 dice and you activate a Kit, you'll only have 2 dice to use in the upcoming Challenge.</p>

<p>This creates an interesting trade-off: powerful buffs at the cost of action economy.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Party Discussion</h3>

<p>Talk with your teammates. Coordinate strategy. Review the next Challenge card (which was revealed during the last Rewards Phase). Decide who needs what equipment. Trade Gold if necessary to help a teammate buy a critical card later.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Ready Check and Enter Challenge</h3>

<p>When everyone is ready, proceed to the Challenge Phase. The next Challenge card has already been revealed, so you know what you're walking into.</p>

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="challenge">CHALLENGE PHASE</h2>

<h2>Challenge Card Anatomy</h2>

<p>Each Challenge card contains the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Challenge ID and Type:</strong> Identifies whether this is a Combat, Skill, or Hybrid Challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy, Medium, or Hard.</li>
<li><strong>Treasure Roll:</strong> Specifies which die to roll and what numbers succeed. If successful, a Treasure card is drawn.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Describes which monsters to spawn, how many, and any environmental hazards or special rules.</li>
<li><strong>Win Condition:</strong> Clearly states what the party must accomplish to succeed.</li>
<li><strong>Time Limit:</strong> The maximum number of rounds allowed. If time runs out, the Challenge fails.</li>
<li><strong>Success Rewards:</strong> Gold and any bonus rewards for completing the Challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Failure Penalties:</strong> HP loss and other consequences for failing.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Modifiers:</strong> Ways to increase difficulty in exchange for bonus rewards (adding monsters, doubling HP, reducing time, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge Start: Treasure Roll</h2>

<p>At the very beginning of a Challenge, before anyone takes any actions, one player makes a Treasure Roll. Check the Challenge card to see which die to roll and which numbers count as success.</p>

<p>For example, the Challenge might say "D6 (Even)" which means roll a D6 and succeed on a 2, 4, or 6 (50% chance). Or it might say "D20 (18)" which means roll a D20 and succeed only on an 18 (5% chance).</p>

<p>Roll the die. If you succeed, draw one card from the Treasure Deck and place it face-down in the Arena. If you fail, no Treasure appears this Challenge.</p>

<p>The Treasure card stays face-down until a player spends their turn attempting to open it (see "Attempting Treasure" later).</p>

<p>You cannot modify the Treasure Roll with stats or abilities. It's pure luck.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Read the Challenge card carefully and set up the Arena accordingly.</p>

<h3>Spawn Monsters</h3>

<p>The Challenge card tells you which monsters to spawn. Some Challenges list specific monsters by name (e.g., "2-3 Goblin Scouts"), while others say "Draw 2 random monsters from the deck."</p>

<p>Monster counts and HP scale based on party size:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1-2 Players:</strong> Use the lower count and/or lower HP multiplier.</li>
<li><strong>3-4 Players:</strong> Use the higher count and/or higher HP multiplier.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a Challenge might say "1 Goblin Warrior (2× HP for 1-2 players, 4× HP for 3-4 players)." If you have 2 players, the Goblin Warrior has double its normal HP. If you have 4 players, it has quadruple HP.</p>

<p>Place the monster cards in the Arena and note their Initiative values (listed on the monster cards).</p>

<h3>Apply Environment</h3>

<p>If the Challenge specifies an Environment card (e.g., "Burning Floor" or "High Winds"), place that card in the Arena. Environment effects apply to <em>everyone</em>—players and monsters alike.</p>

<p>Read the Environment card to understand its ongoing effect.</p>

<h3>Set Up Objectives</h3>

<p>Some Challenges include destructible objects (locked chests, alarm bells, hostages, etc.). Place markers or cards to represent these objectives and note their HP and any special rules.</p>

<strong>Important Reminder:</strong> Magic Ain't Cheap does not use positioning mechanics. Monsters and players simply exist in the Arena together. There's no concept of distance, movement, or "closest target."

<h2>Initiative and Turn Order</h2>

<p>At the start of the Challenge, determine the turn order by calculating Initiative values.</p>

<strong>For Players:</strong> Each player rolls one die and adds their Speed stat. For example, if you roll a D8 and get a 6, and your Speed is 3, your Initiative is 9.

<strong>For Monsters:</strong> Monsters have a fixed Initiative value listed on their card. They do not roll.

<strong>For Objects:</strong> Objects (chests, bells, etc.) do not take turns. They are attacked or interacted with on player turns.

<p>Compare all Initiative values. The highest Initiative acts first. If there's a tie, players choose the order among tied participants.</p>

<strong>Example Turn Order:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Player A (rolled 6 on D8 + Speed 3 = Initiative 9)</li>
<li>Monster (Initiative 7)</li>
<li>Player B (rolled 3 on D6 + Speed 1 = Initiative 4)</li>
<li>Player C (rolled 2 on D4 + Speed 0 = Initiative 2)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Important:</strong> Rolling a die for Initiative does <em>not</em> exhaust it. You can still use that die during the Challenge.

<h2>Round Structure</h2>

<p>A "Round" is one full cycle where every participant (players and monsters) takes one turn.</p>

<strong>Round Sequence:</strong>

<p>1. <strong>Start of Round:</strong> Trigger any "start of round" effects. For example, monsters with Regeneration heal HP now. Environment effects like Burning Floor deal damage now. All Exhausted cards (abilities, items with stat tags) reset and become available again.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Turns in Initiative Order:</strong> Starting with the highest Initiative, each participant takes their turn.</p>

<p>3. <strong>End of Round:</strong> Trigger any "end of round" effects. For example, Poison tokens deal damage now. Check the Challenge's time limit—if the maximum number of rounds has been reached, the Challenge immediately fails.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Start Next Round:</strong> If the Challenge is still ongoing, begin a new round.</p>

<strong>Time Limits:</strong> Each Challenge has a maximum number of rounds (e.g., "Time Limit: 8 Rounds"). If you don't complete the Win Condition by the end of the final round, the Challenge automatically fails and you suffer the Failure Penalties.

<h2>Player Turn: Action Economy</h2>

<p>On your turn, you can take <em>multiple actions</em> as long as you have the resources to pay for them. You are not limited to "one action per turn." Instead, you're limited by your available dice, HP, Gold, and cards.</p>

<strong>Key Principle:</strong> Each action typically costs one die. Once you've used a die for an action, it moves from your Unactivated Dice Pool to your Exhausted Dice Pool. You cannot use that die again this turn. At the end of the turn (or round), all dice reset and move back to the Unactivated Pool.

<h3>Common Actions (Require Resources)</h3>

<strong>Attack:</strong> Choose a target (monster or object), select one die from your Unactivated Pool, roll it, and resolve the attack (see "Attack Action" below). The die moves to your Exhausted Pool.

<strong>Skill Test:</strong> Attempt a stat-based test (if the Challenge requires it). Choose one die, roll it, modify the result with your stat, and determine success or failure (see "Skill Test Action" below). The die moves to your Exhausted Pool.

<strong>Use Ability:</strong> Activate an ability card. The cost varies depending on the card—some require a die roll, some require HP, some require Gold, and some require exhausting the card itself. Follow the card's instructions.

<strong>Attempt Treasure:</strong> If a Treasure card is present, you can spend your turn trying to open it. This uses one die for <em>all</em> the tests on the Treasure card (see "Attempting Treasure" below).

<strong>Interact with Object:</strong> Attack a destructible object (like a door or chest) or attempt to unlock it with a skill test. This costs one die.

<h3>Free Actions (No Resource Cost)</h3>

<strong>Communicate:</strong> Talk with your teammates. Plan strategy. Warn them about threats. There's no limit to communication.

<strong>Command Token:</strong> If you've summoned a Token (Skeleton, Clone, or Guardian), you can give it orders. Tokens either act on your turn or have their own Initiative (depending on the specific Token card).

<strong>Check Information:</strong> Review cards in your hand, check enemy stats, look at the Challenge card, etc. No penalty for gathering information.

<strong>End Turn:</strong> Declare that you're done taking actions. This is always free.

<h3>Example Multi-Action Turn</h3>

<p>Let's say you have 3 dice in your Unactivated Pool (D6, D8, D12).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Action 1:</strong> Attack with your sword (roll D8). The attack hits. D8 moves to Exhausted Pool.</li>
<li><strong>Action 2:</strong> Attack again with your sword (roll D12). The attack crits! D12 moves to Exhausted Pool.</li>
<li><strong>Action 3:</strong> Use an ability that requires a die roll (roll D6). The ability activates. D6 moves to Exhausted Pool.</li>
<li><strong>Out of dice:</strong> You've used all your dice. Your turn ends.</li>
</ul>

<p>You took three actions in one turn because you had three dice available. If you had more dice, you could take more actions.</p>

<h3>Reactions (Triggered by Events)</h3>

<p>Some abilities are "Reactions" that trigger in response to specific events (e.g., "When you're attacked" or "When an ally takes damage"). Reactions interrupt the normal turn order and resolve immediately when triggered. Check the ability card for its cost and effect.</p>

<h2>Attack Action (Detailed Resolution)</h2>

<p>Attacking is the most common action you'll take during a Challenge. Here's how it works step by step:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Declare Target</h3>

<p>Choose a monster or object to attack. It must be a valid target (not already dead, within the rules of the Challenge).</p>

<h3>Step 2: Choose Die</h3>

<p>Select one die from your Unactivated Dice Pool. Consider the weapon or spell's Dice Affinity (the recommended die listed on the card). For example, a weapon that says "D4" is optimized for a D4.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Roll Die</h3>

<p>Roll the die and note the result. The die immediately moves from your Unactivated Pool to your Exhausted Pool.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Check for Hit or Miss</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Natural 1:</strong> Automatic miss. No damage is dealt. Your turn is wasted. The die is still exhausted. Some monsters have the "Evasive" keyword, which means they gain +1 Block whenever they're missed—so missing can make them harder to kill.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Maximum (e.g., 20 on a D20):</strong> Critical hit! Proceed to damage calculation, then double the final damage.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Any Other Result:</strong> Normal hit. Proceed to damage calculation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Calculate Base Damage</h3>

<p>Start with the weapon or spell's base damage value (listed on the card). For example, an Axe might have 6 base damage.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Add Stat Modifier</h3>

<p>Add the relevant stat to the damage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Usually add Might. Some weapons (like daggers or knives) use Speed instead. Check the card.</li>
<li><strong>Spells:</strong> Always add Intelligence.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if you're using an Axe (6 base damage) and your Might is 3, you add 3 damage for a total of 9.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Add Other Modifiers</h3>

<p>Add any bonuses from abilities, buffs, Environment effects, or temporary effects. For example, if you have an ability that says "+2 damage to your next attack," add 2 here.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Apply Target's Block</h3>

<p>The target reduces your damage by their Block value. Block represents armor, toughness, or defensive abilities.</p>

<p>However, there's a minimum damage rule: you always deal at least 1 damage on a hit. Block cannot reduce damage below 1.</p>

<p>For example, if your total damage is 9 and the target has 2 Block, the final damage is 9 - 2 = 7. If your total damage is 2 and the target has 5 Block, the final damage is still 1 (not 0 or negative).</p>

<h3>Step 9: Deal Final Damage</h3>

<p>Reduce the target's HP by the final damage amount. If the target's HP reaches 0, it dies or is destroyed.</p>

<h3>Step 10: Trigger On-Hit Effects</h3>

<p>Some monsters and abilities have effects that trigger when damage is dealt. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A monster with the "Berserker" keyword immediately attacks a random other player when it deals damage.</li>
<li>A monster with the "Poison" keyword inflicts a Poison token on the target.</li>
<li>An ability might say "On hit, heal 2 HP."</li>
</ul>

<p>Resolve these effects now.</p>

<h3>Attack Example (Full Walkthrough)</h3>

<strong>Setup:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You have an Axe equipped (D12, 6 base damage).</li>
<li>Your Might is 3.</li>
<li>You have D12 and D8 in your Unactivated Pool.</li>
<li>The target is a Goblin Warrior (10 HP, 1 Block).</li>
</ul>

<strong>Resolution:</strong>

<p>1. <strong>Declare Target:</strong> "I attack the Goblin Warrior."</p>
<p>2. <strong>Choose Die:</strong> D12 (the Axe recommends D12).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Roll:</strong> You roll 9 (a hit).</p>
<p>4. <strong>Check Result:</strong> Not a 1, not a 12, so it's a normal hit.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Base Damage:</strong> 6 (Axe).</p>
<p>6. <strong>Add Might:</strong> 6 + 3 = 9 total damage.</p>
<p>7. <strong>No Other Modifiers:</strong> 9 damage.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Apply Block:</strong> 9 - 1 = 8 final damage.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Deal Damage:</strong> The Goblin takes 8 damage (10 HP → 2 HP remaining).</p>
<p>10. <strong>No Triggers:</strong> The Goblin has no on-hit effects.</p>

<strong>Result:</strong> The Goblin Warrior survives with 2 HP. Your D12 is now exhausted. You could use your D8 to attack again (or take a different action).

<h3>Critical Hit Example</h3>

<p>Same setup, but you roll a 12 (natural max on D12).</p>

<ul>
<li>Base damage: 6 + 3 = 9</li>
<li>Apply Block: 9 - 1 = 8</li>
<li><strong>Critical Hit:</strong> 8 × 2 = <strong>16 final damage</strong></li>
<li>The Goblin takes 16 damage and dies instantly (overkill by 6).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miss Example</h3>

<p>Same setup, but you roll a 1 (natural minimum).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic miss.</strong> No damage dealt.</li>
<li>The Goblin is unharmed.</li>
<li>Your D12 is exhausted (wasted).</li>
<li>If the Goblin has the "Evasive" keyword, it gains +1 Block.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skill Test Action (Detailed Resolution)</h2>

<p>Skill Challenges and some Hybrid Challenges require you to pass stat-based tests. Unlike attacks, skill tests don't deal damage—they determine whether you succeed at an objective.</p>

<h3>When Skill Tests Are Used</h3>

<p>Skill tests are required for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skill Challenges (non-combat puzzles, obstacles, traps)</li>
<li>Hybrid Challenges (combat + objectives)</li>
<li>Opening Treasure cards</li>
<li>Interacting with locked objects</li>
<li>Activating certain abilities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test Types: High vs. Low</h3>

<p>There are two types of skill tests:</p>

<strong>High Test:</strong> You're trying to roll <em>high</em>. Add your stat to the die roll to increase the result. The higher your modified roll, the better. For example, a "Speed Test (High)" means roll a die, add your Speed stat, and aim for a high number.

<strong>Low Test:</strong> You're trying to roll <em>low</em>. Subtract your stat from the die roll to decrease the result. The lower your modified roll, the better. For example, a "Luck Test (Low)" means roll a die, subtract your Luck stat, and aim for a low number.

<p>Challenges only specify "High" or "Low." There are no fixed target numbers like "you must roll 10 or higher." Instead, success is determined contextually by the table. Generally, a high modified result on a High Test is good, and a low modified result on a Low Test is good.</p>

<h3>Skill Test Steps</h3>

<strong>Step 1: Challenge Specifies Test</strong>

<p>The Challenge card tells you what kind of test is needed. For example: "Speed Test (High)" or "INT Test (Low)."</p>

<strong>Step 2: Choose Die</strong>

<p>Select one die from your Unactivated Pool. If you're attempting a Treasure card, you must use the <em>same</em> die for all tests on that card (see "Attempting Treasure" below).</p>

<strong>Step 3: Roll Die</strong>

<p>Roll the die and note the result. The die moves to your Exhausted Pool.</p>

<strong>Step 4: Modify Result with Stat</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>High Test:</strong> Add the relevant stat to your roll.</li>
<li><strong>Low Test:</strong> Subtract the relevant stat from your roll.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Step 5: Determine Success or Failure</strong>

<p>The party or table determines whether your modified result is good enough.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High Test:</strong> Generally, higher is better. A result of 10+ is usually good. 15+ is excellent. Results below 5 are usually failures.</li>
<li><strong>Low Test:</strong> Generally, lower is better. A result of 3 or less is usually good. 1-2 is excellent. Results above 6 are usually failures.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Step 6: Apply Consequences</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Success:</strong> Progress toward the Win Condition, unlock something, avoid a trap, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Failure:</strong> Take damage, lose progress, trigger a penalty, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>High Test Example</h3>

<strong>Setup:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Challenge requires: "Speed Test (High)"</li>
<li>Your Speed is 3.</li>
<li>You have a D10 in your Unactivated Pool.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Resolution:</strong>

<p>1. Roll D10: Result is 8.</p>
<p>2. Modify (High Test): 8 + 3 = 11.</p>
<p>3. Determine Success: 11 is a high result. Success!</p>

<strong>Outcome:</strong> You pass the test and unlock the door.

<h3>Low Test Example</h3>

<strong>Setup:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Challenge requires: "Luck Test (Low)"</li>
<li>Your Luck is 2.</li>
<li>You have a D6 in your Unactivated Pool.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Resolution:</strong>

<p>1. Roll D6: Result is 5.</p>
<p>2. Modify (Low Test): 5 - 2 = 3.</p>
<p>3. Determine Success: 3 is a low result. Success!</p>

<strong>Outcome:</strong> You pass the test and avoid the trap.

<h3>Choosing Which Stat to Modify (Treasure Cards Only)</h3>

<p>Some Treasure cards allow you to choose which stat to use. For example, a Treasure might say "Use Speed, INT, or Luck." You must pick <em>one</em> stat to use for <em>all</em> tests on that Treasure card. You cannot mix stats.</p>

<p>For example, if a Treasure requires "2 Speed Tests (High), 1 Luck Test (Low)," you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Speed for all 3 tests, OR</li>
<li>Use Luck for all 3 tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose strategically based on your stats.</p>

<h2>Monster Turns</h2>

<p>Monsters follow simple AI rules. On a monster's turn:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Trigger Start-of-Turn Abilities:</strong> For example, if the monster has "Regeneration," it heals HP now.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Choose Target:</strong> The monster attacks a player. Most monsters attack the nearest player or a random player. Check the monster card for specific behavior.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Attack:</strong> The monster rolls its attack die (listed on its card), checks for hit/miss, calculates damage, and deals damage to the target.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Trigger On-Hit Abilities:</strong> If the monster hits, abilities like "Berserker" or "Poison" activate.</p>
<p>5. <strong>End Turn.</strong></p>

<h3>Monster Attack Steps</h3>

<p>Monster attacks work similarly to player attacks:</p>

<p>1. Roll the monster's attack die.</p>
<p>2. Check for natural 1 (miss) or natural max (crit).</p>
<p>3. Calculate damage: Base Damage + Stat.</p>
<p>4. The player reduces damage by their Block.</p>
<p>5. Apply final damage to the player's HP.</p>

<h3>Monster Keyword Abilities</h3>

<p>Monsters on Floor 1 have six keyword abilities:</p>

<strong>Berserker:</strong> When this monster deals damage to a player, it immediately makes a bonus attack on a random other player. The bonus attack uses the same die and damage calculation.

<strong>Pack Hunter:</strong> This monster deals +2 damage for each allied monster in the combat. For example, if there are 2 other monsters alive, this monster deals +4 damage. Pack Hunter damage stacks and can make groups very dangerous.

<strong>Evasive:</strong> Each time a player misses an attack against this monster (rolls a natural 1), the monster gains +1 Block. This bonus is cumulative within the round. At the end of the round, the bonus resets. Evasive monsters become harder to hurt if you keep missing.

<strong>Regeneration:</strong> At the start of this monster's turn, it heals a specific amount of HP (listed on the card, usually 3-10 HP). This makes it very hard to kill unless you can deal damage faster than it regenerates.

<strong>Poison:</strong> When this monster deals damage to a player, that player gains a Poison token. Poison tokens deal 2 HP damage at the start of the player's turn for 3 rounds. Poison stacks—if you get hit twice, you take 4 damage per turn for 3 rounds.

<strong>Treasure Guardian:</strong> When this monster is defeated, the party automatically succeeds at the Treasure Roll (if one is present). Guaranteed loot!

<h2>Attempting Treasure</h2>

<p>If a Treasure card is present in the Arena (from a successful Treasure Roll at the start of the Challenge), any player can spend their turn attempting to open it.</p>

<strong>How It Works:</strong>

<p>1. Declare: "I attempt Treasure." This uses one die, which counts as taking an action.</p>
<p>2. Flip the Treasure card face-up.</p>
<p>3. The Treasure card shows several Skill Tests (e.g., "2 Speed Tests (High), 1 INT Test (Low)").</p>
<p>4. Choose one die from your Unactivated Pool. You must use this <em>same die</em> for <em>all</em> tests on the card.</p>
<p>5. If the card allows it, choose which stat to use (Speed, INT, or Luck). You must use the same stat for all tests.</p>
<p>6. Perform each test one by one: roll the die, modify with your stat, determine success or failure.</p>
<p>7. Based on your results (how many tests you passed), the Treasure card grants rewards or penalties.</p>
<p>8. Discard the Treasure card. It's used up.</p>

<strong>Important:</strong> You cannot skip tests. You must complete all of them, even if you're failing. However, partial success often gives partial rewards.

<strong>Example:</strong>

<p>Treasure card says: "1 Speed Test (High), 1 Luck Test (Low). Full success = +20 HP. Partial success = +10 HP."</p>

<p>You choose your D8 and decide to use Speed for both tests (since you have Speed 3).</p>

<ul>
<li>Test 1 (High): Roll D8 (result 7) + Speed 3 = 10. Success!</li>
<li>Test 2 (Low): Roll D8 (result 2) - Speed 3 = -1. Success!</li>
</ul>

<p>Both tests passed! You gain +20 HP.</p>

<h2>Win Conditions</h2>

<p>Each Challenge has a specific Win Condition listed on the card. Common Win Conditions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Defeat all monsters" (reduce all enemy HP to 0)</li>
<li>"Complete X Stat Tests" (pass a certain number of skill tests)</li>
<li>"Destroy the object" (reduce an object's HP to 0)</li>
<li>"Keep the hostage alive and defeat all monsters" (dual objective)</li>
<li>"Escape (complete tests) OR fight (defeat all)" (choice of approach)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you achieve the Win Condition, the Challenge immediately ends in success. Proceed to the Rewards Phase.</p>

<h2>Fail Conditions</h2>

<p>The Challenge fails if:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Time Limit Reached:</strong> You didn't complete the Win Condition before the maximum number of rounds elapsed.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Specific Fail Condition Met:</strong> For example, the hostage dies, the alarm bell rings, or the party is wiped out.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Party Recalls:</strong> The party voluntarily exits the Challenge (see below).</p>

<p>When the Challenge fails, it immediately ends. You suffer the Failure Penalties and proceed to the Rewards Phase.</p>

<h2>Recall Mechanic (Voluntary Failure)</h2>

<p>At any point during a Challenge, any player can propose a Recall. The party votes (majority rules). If the vote passes, the Challenge immediately ends and counts as a failure.</p>

<strong>Why Recall?</strong>

<p>Recalling is a strategic retreat. If the Challenge is going badly, you might want to cut your losses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save HP (prevent a total wipe)</li>
<li>Preserve resources (don't waste more dice or abilities)</li>
<li>Regroup and try the next Challenge instead</li>
</ul>

<strong>Cost of Recalling:</strong>

<ul>
<li>You suffer the Challenge's Failure Penalties (HP loss, no Gold, etc.).</li>
<li>You might lose the strategic preview of the next Challenge (some Challenges have "Hide Next Challenge" penalties).</li>
<li>You make no progress and waste time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recalling is a last resort, but it can prevent a catastrophic total party wipe.</p>

<h2>Player Death</h2>

<p>If a player's HP is reduced to 0 during a Challenge, that player is "knocked out." They cannot take any more actions for the rest of the Challenge.</p>

<p>After the Challenge ends (whether in success or failure), all knocked-out players respawn in the Green Room at 50% of their maximum HP. For example, if your max HP is 30, you respawn at 15 HP. You keep all your equipment and Gold.</p>

<strong>Total Party Wipe:</strong>

<p>If <em>all</em> players are knocked out simultaneously, the Challenge immediately fails. All players respawn in the Green Room at 50% HP. You suffer the Failure Penalties and must proceed to the Rewards Phase.</p>

<strong>Death is not permanent</strong> in Magic Ain't Cheap. The corporate sponsors revive you because the show must go on!

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="rewards">REWARDS PHASE</h2>

<p>After completing (or failing) a Challenge, you enter the Rewards Phase. This is where you reap the benefits of success—or suffer the consequences of failure.</p>

<h2>Rewards Phase Order</h2>

<p>Follow these steps in order:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Reveal Next Challenge Card ⭐</h3>

<p>This is the most important step and it happens <em>first</em>, before anything else.</p>

<p>Flip the next Challenge card on the Floor Tracker face-up. The party now knows what's coming next. This happens <em>before</em> you receive your rewards and <em>before</em> you draft new cards. This is intentional—you can see what's ahead and shop accordingly.</p>

<strong>Exception:</strong> If the Challenge you just completed had a "Hide Next Challenge" penalty (common on Medium and Hard difficulties), the next Challenge card stays face-down. You won't see it until after you finish drafting and purchasing cards. This is a significant disadvantage.

<h3>Step 2: Determine Success or Failure</h3>

<p>Did you complete the Win Condition? Or did you fail (time limit, specific failure condition, or Recall)?</p>

<h3>Step 3: Award Success Rewards or Apply Failure Penalties</h3>

<strong>If Successful:</strong>

<p>You gain the Gold listed on the Challenge card. For example, "40G total for party." The party decides how to distribute this Gold among players.</p>

<p>Some Challenges also grant bonus rewards, such as "+1 Reward Draw" (each player draws one extra card during the next draft) or special items.</p>

<strong>If Failed:</strong>

<p>Each player loses HP as specified on the Challenge card (e.g., "Each player loses 10 HP"). You gain 0 Gold from the Challenge's base reward.</p>

<p>If the Challenge has a "Hide Next Challenge: Yes" penalty, you did not reveal the next Challenge in Step 1. It remains face-down.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Gold Distribution (Damage-Based)</h3>

<p>In addition to the base Challenge rewards, the party earns bonus Gold based on damage dealt and damage taken during the Challenge.</p>

<strong>Gold from Damage Dealt:</strong> For every 2 damage dealt (after Block is applied), the party earns 1 Gold. For example, if the party dealt a total of 40 damage, they earn 20 Gold. Distribute this Gold among the players who dealt damage (party decides the split).

<strong>Gold from Damage Taken:</strong> For every 2 damage taken (after Block is applied), the party earns 1 Gold. For example, if the party took a total of 30 damage, they earn 15 Gold. Distribute this Gold among all players (party decides the split).

<strong>Total Gold Earned:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Base Challenge Reward (or 0 if failed)</li>
<li>\+ Damage Dealt Gold</li>
<li>\+ Damage Taken Gold</li>
<li>\= Total Gold Pool</li>
</ul>

<p>The party divides this Gold however they see fit. You can freely trade Gold with teammates at any time.</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> If you activated Optional Modifiers (like adding extra monsters), the Gold conversion rate may be adjusted to prevent exploiting the system.

<h3>Step 5: Treasure Rewards</h3>

<p>If you successfully opened a Treasure card during the Challenge, you already received its rewards (or penalties) when you attempted it. There's no additional processing here.</p>

<p>If you did <em>not</em> attempt the Treasure card during the Challenge, it's a lost opportunity. The card is discarded.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Purchase Cards</h3>

<strong>This is the only time you can buy Reward cards.</strong>

<p>You can now purchase cards from two sources:</p>

<strong>From Your Hand (Drafted Cards):</strong>

<p>During the last Rewards Phase (or at character creation), you drafted several cards. Now you can buy them by paying their Gold cost. Once purchased, cards move from your hand to your "owned cards" pool and can be equipped in the Green Room.</p>

<strong>From the Discard Pile:</strong>

<p>Any player can buy cards from the communal discard pile by paying their Gold cost. This represents scavenging used equipment.</p>

<strong>Trading Gold:</strong>

<p>Players can freely give or trade Gold to each other at any time. Help your teammates buy critical cards if needed.</p>

<strong>Important:</strong> You cannot purchase Reward cards during the Green Room Phase. This is the <em>only</em> time you can buy them.

<h3>Step 7: Reward Draft (For Next Challenge)</h3>

<p>After purchasing cards, each player drafts new cards from the Reward Deck. The number of cards drafted depends on your difficulty mode:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy Mode:</strong> Draw 6 cards.</li>
<li><strong>Medium Mode:</strong> Draw 5 cards.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Mode:</strong> Draw 4 cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Review your drafted cards privately. You may trade them with teammates according to your difficulty mode:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy Mode:</strong> Free trading.</li>
<li><strong>Medium Mode:</strong> 5 Gold per trade.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Mode:</strong> No trading.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep all drafted cards in your hand. You can only purchase them during the <em>next</em> Rewards Phase (after the next Challenge ends).</p>

<strong>Strategic Timing:</strong> You just saw the next Challenge card in Step 1. Draft cards that will help you with that Challenge!

<h3>Step 8: Return to Green Room</h3>

<p>The Rewards Phase ends. You now enter the Green Room Phase to rest, equip gear, and prepare for the next Challenge.</p>

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="bosses">LEVEL UP AND BOSS FIGHTS</h2>

<h2>When You Level Up</h2>

<p>After completing 3 Challenges, you gain a level. Leveling up grants you one additional die.</p>

<strong>Level Up Schedule:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>After Challenge 3 (End of Level 1):</strong> Gain +1 die (you now have 2 dice).</li>
<li><strong>After Challenge 6 (End of Level 2):</strong> Proceed to Boss Fight (you still have 2 dice).</li>
<li><strong>After Defeating the Boss:</strong> Gain +1 die (you now have 3 dice). Proceed to Floor 2.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Choosing Your New Die:</strong>

<p>When you gain a die, you choose which type (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, or D20). Add it to your Unactivated Dice Pool immediately.</p>

<strong>Maximum Dice:</strong> You can have a maximum of 6 dice by the end of the game (Final Boss on Floor 3).

<strong>Dice Cannot Be Purchased:</strong> The only way to gain dice is through leveling up. Gold cannot buy more dice.

<h2>Progression Schedule</h2>

<strong>Floor 1:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Start: 1 die (Level 1)</li>
<li>After Challenge 3: 2 dice (Level 2)</li>
<li>After Boss: 3 dice (Floor 2 begins)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Floor 2:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Start: 3 dice (Level 3)</li>
<li>After Challenge 9: 4 dice (Level 4)</li>
<li>After Boss: 5 dice (Floor 3 begins)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Floor 3:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Start: 5 dice (Level 5)</li>
<li>After Challenge 15: 6 dice (Level 6)</li>
<li>Final Boss: 6 dice (maximum power)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Boss Mechanics</h2>

<p>Bosses are special, super-powered Challenges that mark the end of each Floor. They are significantly harder than regular Challenges.</p>

<h3>Boss Setup</h3>

<p>Boss cards function like Challenge cards but with much higher stakes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Higher HP:</strong> Boss HP scales dramatically with player count (e.g., 40/50/65/80 for 1/2/3/4 players).</li>
<li><strong>Higher Block:</strong> Bosses have more armor than normal monsters.</li>
<li><strong>Better Stats:</strong> Bosses have stats of 3-5 (compared to 0-2 for normal monsters).</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Abilities:</strong> Bosses have 2-3 keyword abilities (Berserker, Pack Hunter, Regeneration, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase System</h3>

<p>Bosses have 2-3 phases based on HP thresholds. As the Boss loses HP, its behavior and abilities change.</p>

<p>For example, a Boss might have:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1 (100%-50% HP):</strong> Normal attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2 (50%-0% HP):</strong> Gains AOE attacks, summons minions, or increases Regeneration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the Boss card carefully to understand when phase transitions occur and what changes.</p>

<h3>Boss-Specific Rules</h3>

<p>Each Boss has unique mechanics listed on its card. Some Bosses summon minions, activate environment effects, or have special win/fail conditions. Follow the card's instructions.</p>

<h3>Time Limit</h3>

<p>Bosses have longer time limits than regular Challenges (typically 10-15 rounds), but you must still defeat them before time runs out or the Challenge fails.</p>

<h3>Cannot Recall from Boss</h3>

<p>You cannot voluntarily Recall from a Boss fight. You must fight to the end. If all players are knocked out, the Boss fight immediately fails, all players respawn in the Green Room at 50% HP, and you must retry the Boss.</p>

<p>The Boss's HP resets to full when you retry.</p>

<h2>Boss Rewards (Success)</h2>

<p>Defeating a Boss grants massive rewards:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Large Gold Payout:</strong> 80-150 Gold (depending on Boss difficulty).</li>
<li><strong>Bonus Reward Draws:</strong> Each player gains +2 to +5 extra Reward Draft cards.</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed Treasure:</strong> Bosses always have a 100% Treasure Roll (automatic success).</li>
<li><strong>Special Bonuses:</strong> Some Bosses grant unique rewards, like choosing a Best-tier card from the discard pile.</li>
<li><strong>Gain +1 Die:</strong> All players level up and gain one additional die.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock Next Floor:</strong> You proceed to the next Floor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boss victories are huge milestones. Celebrate!</p>

<h2>Boss Failure</h2>

<p>If you fail to defeat the Boss:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy HP Loss:</strong> Each player loses 25-40 HP (depending on Boss).</li>
<li><strong>Respawn:</strong> All players respawn in the Green Room.</li>
<li><strong>Boss HP Resets:</strong> The Boss is fully restored.</li>
<li><strong>No Progression:</strong> You cannot proceed to the next Floor until you defeat the Boss.</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited Retries:</strong> You can retry the Boss as many times as needed. Shop, re-equip, and try again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dice Pool System</h2>

<p>Your dice pool represents your available actions. The more dice you have, the more actions you can take per turn.</p>

<h3>Dice Pool Areas</h3>

<strong>Unactivated Dice Pool:</strong> Dice here are available to use this turn. At the start of your turn (or round), all your dice should be here (unless some were exhausted by Kits).

<strong>Exhausted Dice Pool:</strong> When you use a die for an action, it moves here. You cannot use exhausted dice again until they reset.

<h3>Dice Reset</h3>

<p>At the end of your turn (or at the end of the round, depending on the mechanic), all dice move from the Exhausted Pool back to the Unactivated Pool. They're ready to use again.</p>

<h3>Kit Exception</h3>

<p>When you activate a Kit in the Green Room, you move one die from Unactivated to Exhausted <em>without rolling it</em>. That die remains exhausted for the entire next Challenge.</p>

<h3>Dice Options</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>D4 (1-4):</strong> Consistent, low variance. Good for abilities that need reliable results.</li>
<li><strong>D6 (1-6):</strong> Balanced.</li>
<li><strong>D8 (1-8):</strong> Good damage.</li>
<li><strong>D10 (1-10):</strong> Higher risk, higher reward.</li>
<li><strong>D12 (1-12):</strong> High damage potential.</li>
<li><strong>D20 (1-20):</strong> Extreme variance. Can roll 1 (miss) or 20 (crit).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Damage Calculation</h2>

<strong>Formula:</strong>

<p>Total Damage = Base Damage + Stat Bonus + Modifiers - Target Block (minimum 1)</p>

<strong>Components:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Base Damage:</strong> Listed on the weapon or spell card.</li>
<li><strong>Stat Bonus:</strong> Add Might (for weapons) or Intelligence (for spells).</li>
<li><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Abilities, buffs, Environment effects.</li>
<li><strong>Target Block:</strong> The target's armor value. Subtract this from your damage.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Minimum Damage Rule:</strong> Always deal at least 1 damage on a hit. Block cannot reduce damage to 0 or below.

<h2>Block (Armor)</h2>

<p>Block is a defensive value that reduces incoming damage. It's subtracted from the attacker's damage total, but cannot reduce damage below 1.</p>

<strong>Sources of Block:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Armor cards equipped in slots (Head, Body, Arms, Legs, Hands)</li>
<li>Monster stats (innate armor)</li>
<li>Temporary buffs from abilities</li>
</ul>

<strong>Stacking:</strong> Multiple armor pieces stack. For example, if you have Head armor (1 Block), Body armor (2 Block), and a Shield (1 Block), your total Block is 4.

<h2>HP and Death</h2>

<strong>Hit Points (HP)</strong> represent your health. When you take damage, reduce your HP. When your HP reaches 0, you're knocked out.

<strong>Healing:</strong> The only way to heal is through Resting Rolls in the Green Room. Roll a die and heal HP equal to the result. There are no healing potions or healing spells.

<strong>Death:</strong> When you reach 0 HP during a Challenge, you're knocked out and cannot take actions for the rest of the Challenge. After the Challenge ends, you respawn in the Green Room at 50% HP. You keep all equipment and Gold.

<strong>Total Party Wipe:</strong> If all players reach 0 HP, the Challenge immediately fails. Everyone respawns at 50% HP.

<h2>Gold Economy</h2>

<p>Gold is the currency in Magic Ain't Cheap. Everything costs money—spells, weapons, armor, and more.</p>

<h3>Earning Gold</h3>

<ul>
<li>Challenge success rewards</li>
<li>Damage dealt (1 Gold per 2 damage)</li>
<li>Damage taken (1 Gold per 2 damage)</li>
<li>Treasure card rewards</li>
<li>Boss rewards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spending Gold</h3>

<ul>
<li>Buy Reward cards from your hand (only during Rewards Phase)</li>
<li>Buy cards from the discard pile (only during Rewards Phase)</li>
<li>Pay trading fees (Medium Mode only, 5 Gold per trade)</li>
</ul>

<strong>You Cannot Buy Dice:</strong> Dice are only gained through leveling up.

<h3>Trading Gold</h3>

<p>Players can freely give or trade Gold with each other at any time. There are no restrictions.</p>

<h2>Stats (The Big Six)</h2>

<p>Your character has six stats that influence various actions:</p>

<strong>Might (M):</strong> Used for physical weapon attacks. Adds to weapon damage. Represents raw strength and melee power.

<strong>Speed (S):</strong> Used for Initiative rolls, Speed Tests, and some weapons (like daggers). Represents agility, reflexes, and quickness.

<strong>Intelligence (INT):</strong> Used for spell attacks and INT Tests. Adds to spell damage. Represents knowledge, magical power, and mental acuity.

<strong>Willpower (WP):</strong> Used for resisting effects, WP Tests, and some abilities. Also determines Guardian Token stats. Represents mental fortitude and resistance.

<strong>Charm (Ch):</strong> Used for social abilities, Charm Tests, and some spells. Also determines Clone Token stats. Represents charisma and persuasion.

<strong>Luck (L):</strong> Used for Luck Tests and some abilities. Represents fortune, fate, and RNG manipulation.

<h3>Starting Stats</h3>

<p>Your starting stats depend on your difficulty mode:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy Mode:</strong> Choose 1 Basic Stat Card (+1 to that stat).</li>
<li><strong>Medium Mode:</strong> Draw 1 random Basic Stat Card (+1 to that stat).</li>
<li><strong>Hard Mode:</strong> Start with all stats at 0.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Increasing Stats</h3>

<p>Stats increase through Enhancement cards. Enhancement cards provide permanent stat bonuses and attach to your character forever. There's no hard cap on stats, but practical limits make 6+ in any single stat very expensive.</p>

<h2>Stat Tags (Exhaustion Rules)</h2>

<p>Some cards have "Stat Tags" like "Might Tag," "Speed Tag," or "INT Tag." These represent techniques or focuses that require concentration.</p>

<p>When you use a card with a Stat Tag, the card Exhausts (rotate it 90 degrees sideways). Exhausted cards cannot be used again this Round.</p>

<p>At the End of Round, all Exhausted cards Reset (rotate back upright). They're available again next round.</p>

<strong>Exhaustion is Round-Based:</strong> Exhaustion lasts until the end of the current round, not the entire Challenge.

<strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Stat Tags prevent you from spamming the same powerful ability repeatedly. You must diversify your strategy.

<h2>Dice Affinity</h2>

<p>Dice Affinity is a recommendation (not a rule) listed on weapon and spell cards. It suggests which die is optimal for that card.</p>

<p>For example, a weapon with low base damage but high stat scaling might recommend a D4 (consistent results). A weapon with high base damage but low stat scaling might recommend a D12 (big swings).</p>

<p>You're not required to follow Dice Affinity, but it helps optimize your attacks.</p>

<h2>Token System</h2>

<p>Tokens are summoned allies that fight alongside you. There are three types:</p>

<strong>Skeleton Token (INT-Based):</strong> An offensive fighter. Its stats scale with your Intelligence.

<strong>Clone Token (Charm-Based):</strong> A versatile copy of you. Its stats scale with your Charm.

<strong>Guardian Token (Willpower-Based):</strong> A defensive tank. Its stats scale with your Willpower.

<h3>How Tokens Work</h3>

<p>1. Use a Token card to summon the Token.</p>
<p>2. The Token acts like a monster under your control.</p>
<p>3. It has its own HP, Block, and Initiative (determined by the Token card and your stats).</p>
<p>4. On the Token's turn (or on your turn, depending on the card), you control its actions.</p>
<p>5. If the Token's HP reaches 0, it's destroyed. You must use the Token card again to re-summon it.</p>

<strong>Token Limits:</strong> You can have a maximum of 1 of each Token type active at once. Total: 3 Tokens maximum (1 Skeleton, 1 Clone, 1 Guardian).

<p>---</p>

<h2 id="cards">CARD TYPES</h2>

<h2>Weapons</h2>

<p>Weapons are physical or ranged attack tools that deal damage. Most weapons scale with Might, though some (like daggers) scale with Speed.</p>

<p>Weapons are equipped in the Hands slots (you have 2 Hands slots). You can dual-wield two weapons or use a weapon and a shield.</p>

<strong>Dice Affinity:</strong> Weapons list a recommended die (e.g., "D4" or "D12").

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Knife (D4, 1 base damage + Speed)</li>
<li>Sword (D8, 4 base damage + Might)</li>
<li>Maul (D12, 6 base damage + Might)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spells</h2>

<p>Spells are magical attacks that scale with Intelligence. Unlike weapons, you can equip as many spells as you want—there's no slot limit for spells.</p>

<p>Spells include elemental strikes (Fire, Ice, Lightning), status effects (Poison, Slow), and AOE spells (hit multiple targets).</p>

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Element Strike Fire (D8, 8 base damage + INT)</li>
<li>Ice Blast (D10, 10 base damage + INT, AOE)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Armor</h2>

<p>Armor cards provide Block, which reduces incoming damage. Armor is equipped in specific body slots:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Head Slot:</strong> Helmets, hats, hoods</li>
<li><strong>Body Slot:</strong> Chest armor, robes, jackets</li>
<li><strong>Arms Slot:</strong> Arm guards, bracers, sleeves</li>
<li><strong>Legs Slot:</strong> Leg armor, pants, greaves</li>
<li><strong>Hands Slots:</strong> Shields (shields count as armor, not weapons)</li>
</ul>

<p>All equipped armor Block values stack together.</p>

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Helmet (1 Block, Head slot)</li>
<li>Chest Plate (2 Block, Body slot)</li>
<li>Shield (1 Block, Hand slot)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Items</h2>

<p>Items provide passive effects or utility bonuses. They do not consume equipment slots (except for the Accessory slot, which holds one item).</p>

<p>Items are always active while equipped.</p>

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lucky Charm (+1 to all Luck Tests, Accessory slot)</li>
<li>Strength Belt (+1 Might, Accessory slot)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<p>Enhancements are permanent stat modifications that attach to your character. They <em>never</em> go into your inventory or hand. Once purchased, they're placed in the Enhancements Area of your player board and stay there forever.</p>

<p>Enhancements provide stat bonuses that are <em>always</em> active. Some Enhancements also have exhaustible abilities, but the stat bonuses remain even when the ability is exhausted.</p>

<strong>Thematic Style:</strong> Enhancements are represented as injections, x-ray therapy, arcane punk implants, injectable medicine, and creams.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Muscle Enhancement Injection (+1 Might)</li>
<li>Neural Implant (+1 INT)</li>
<li>Combat Stimulant (+2 Might, Ability: Exhaust to gain +5 damage this attack)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Counts:</strong> 90 Enhancements on Floor 1, 60 on Floor 2, 30 on Floor 3.

<h2>Abilities</h2>

<p>Abilities are special techniques or powers. They can be passive (always on) or active (use on your turn).</p>

<p>Some abilities cost resources (die rolls, HP, Gold, or exhaustion). Others are free actions.</p>

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Attack (attack twice in one turn)</li>
<li>Counter-Strike (react to being hit)</li>
<li>Critical Master (crits deal triple damage instead of double)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tokens</h2>

<p>Token cards allow you to summon allied creatures (Skeleton, Clone, or Guardian). Tokens act like monsters under your control and scale with your stats. See the Token System section for full rules.</p>

<h2>Favors</h2>

<p>Favors are special one-time-use cards representing gifts from the production team or audience. They provide powerful effects but are consumed after use.</p>

<p>Favors can be used in the Green Room <em>or</em> during a Challenge. They cannot be equipped—they stay in your inventory (hand) until activated.</p>

<strong>Thematic Style:</strong> Favors are designed as absurd coupons—giant novelty checks, index cards taped to hubcaps, oversized vouchers.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor Deal - Health Tonic (Heal 20 HP)</li>
<li>Audience Mercy (Recall without penalty)</li>
<li>Producer's Gift (Gain 50 Gold)</li>
<li>Commercial Break (Pause time limit for 3 rounds)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Counts:</strong> 18 Favors on Floor 1, 12 on Floor 2, 6 on Floor 3.

<h2>Kits</h2>

<p>Kits are large, bulky equipment that can only be used in the Green Room. They provide powerful buffs that last until the end of the next Challenge.</p>

<p>To activate a Kit, you must sacrifice one die—move it from your Unactivated Pool to your Exhausted Pool <em>without rolling it</em>. That die remains exhausted for the entire next Challenge, reducing your action economy.</p>

<p>Kits are equipped in the Equipped Items area but do <em>not</em> count against your equipment slots.</p>

<strong>Thematic Style:</strong> Workout machines, medical stations, ritual circles, crafting benches—items too large or time-consuming to use mid-combat.

<strong>Counts:</strong> 15 Kits on Floor 1, 10 on Floor 2, 5 on Floor 3.
